            <description><![CDATA[Don't give any faith to polls even if you trust the pollster to be honest. Forecasting electoral events is like trying to hit a moving target with a blindfold on.

It's actually pretty amazing that people still talk about polls as if they are anything serious. Any minor systematic error in such a complex system and it all comes crashing down.<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Searx is based. Comparing it to DuckDuckGo and You-Know-Who-gle there's no contest. It aggregates and integrates results from different search engines all without your local machine connecting to them. There are equivalents of DDG !bangtags and you have a lot of say in what engines are used. While it check out https://searx.space for a list of Searx instances, but you can even run a Searx instance on your own server if you don't trust anyone else.<br />

            <description><![CDATA["I use Linux as my operating system," I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. "Actually", he says with a grin, "Linux is just the kernel. You use GNU+Linux!' I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, "I use Alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Literally no one wants to see useless standard output on some parent terminal that will close whatever media file you open from it. dwm solves this problem by having a swallow/swallowing patch: it automatically places media windows exactly over the terminals you start them from. When you exit out of these windows, your terminal is still there, safe and sound. It's basically like consooming media in the terminal itself in terms of efficiency.<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Instead of just telling people "not to distro hop" and to figure it out for themselves, sometimes it's better just to tell them what to do. Just use Manjaro XFCE (https://manjaro.org). When I install Linux on a normie's computer, I've always chosen Manjaro for them and that always works best.<br />

It's an easy to use distro, which has most all of the advantages of Arch Linux, including AUR access, rolling release for muh gaymes for gamers and if you git gud you can also play around with desktop envi<br/><img src="https://thumbnails.lbry.com/eWowqM2S9VU" width="400" alt="New to Linux?

            <description><![CDATA[Paul Feyerabend argued for 'Epistemological Anarchism,' that in order to do truly good science, one can't rule out alternative methods, ad hoc hypotheses, mythology, religion and wishful thinking. Using the example of Galileo, he shows how science's greatest strides are made by deliberately being "unscientific" in the way that court scientists tend to think nowadays.<br />
